# üßπ Data Wrangling with Python

This repository is a collection of projects focused on **data wrangling** using **Python**. It showcases how raw, messy, or unstructured data can be transformed into clean, structured, and analysis-ready formats. The projects here involve working with real-world data sources, applying techniques to collect, clean, reshape, and enrich data.

### üîß What You‚Äôll Find

- **API Integration**: Fetching and processing data from REST APIs using libraries like `requests`, `json`, and `pandas`.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites using `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and `lxml`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, fixing data types, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation**: Reshaping data frames, merging datasets, filtering, grouping, and aggregating information.
- **File Handling**: Reading/writing data from formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, and more.
- **Automation**: Scripts to automate repetitive wrangling tasks for efficient data pipelines.

### üß† Purpose

The main goal of this repo is to demonstrate how to prepare data for further analysis or modeling. Whether the data is messy, incomplete, or scattered across multiple sources, these projects show how to wrangle it effectively using Python.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `requests`, `json`
- `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`
- `re` for regex-based cleaning
- `os`, `glob` for file system operations
